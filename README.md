# ATR-FTIR_fit_gauss_lorentz_deconvolution_D2O
The present code was created as a part of an undergraduate thesis in python, where a quantification of the concentration of heavy water in aqueous solutions was performed, using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy.

The fitting of the data was first done with gaussian curves and then with lorentzian curves, in order to show which fitting was the best for my data.
